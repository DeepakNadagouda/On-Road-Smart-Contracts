#Introduction

Smart contracts to positively influence vehicle driving behavior
using real-time on-road agreements via block-chain

In order to better understand our proposal, let us have a look at some scenarios. Scenario 1 (see adjacent figure): A driver is in a hurry and is willing to pay a small amount to the vehicles in front of him so that they allow him to overtake them (in return for the
incentive). Scenario 2:  An Ambulance or emergency vehicle is making its way to its destination. The
Vehicles around it are more likely to make way if they get an incentive for positive behavior. (Ex: coupons for medical purchase) Scenario 3: Traffic police want to re-route a portion of the vehicles to prevent traffic from
getting worse. The re-routed vehicles are more likely to voluntarily take a different route in
return for an incentive. This scenario can also be further extended to make certain roads
cheaper (or expensive) to ease traffic flow and prevent congestion, paving the way for
dynamic pricing of roads. 

To enable the above mentioned scenarios, we propose a decentralized real-time on-road
smart contract system. This system would handle these transactions seamlessly. In addition,
such a system would form the basis for an automatic on-road smart contract system for
autonomous vehicles in the future.
